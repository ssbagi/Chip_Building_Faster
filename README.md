# Chip_Building_Faster

In Detail Explaination refer this : https://github.com/ssbagi/Chip_Building_Faster/blob/main/Workflow_Execution_Engineer.pdf

**I am Hardware Engineer not Infrastructure Engineer or not Software Engineer**. **I am not interseted to this kind of work there is no Hardware Terms or Chip terms, Testcases runining or understanding the Testcase or Validation**

**Since we need to do faster Tapeout and stuff this Idea can be used. Hire the Software or Infrastructure Engineer for this Kind of work.**

**So, since the repo got changed. I have uploaded the above document in the Copilot And Generated the README.md syntax like this : **

# Workflow

A pragmatic, Git-based methodology to streamline chip execution across pre-silicon to post-silicon, reduce repetitive toil, and enable AI-assisted orchestration for MT/VT/LT flows.

---

## Overview and vision

This README proposes a multi-repo, layered workflow that maps design, verification, physical design, and validation into consistent Git-structured units. It emphasizes centralized visibility (dashboards), reproducibility (CI/CD), and restricted access for sensitive artifacts, so execution engineers can focus on performance and quality rather than babysitting runs.

- **Why:** Eliminate repetitive tasks like launching runs, log probing, license checks, KPI extraction, and termination audits by codifying the flow and enabling automation.
- **What:** A layered DL1/DL2/DL3 repo model per functional domain (RTL, Verification, DFT, PD, BTO/MTO, Post-silicon), aggregated into a top-level integration repo.
- **Who:** Cross-functional squads with clear roles and controlled access (CCI), enabling governance at scale.
- **Outcome:** Faster iteration, auditable traceability, standardized metrics, and an AI-ready foundation for querying, analysis, and orchestration.

---

## Roles and access

Align teams into small, empowered units with clear ownership and CCI-based access control.

- **Team composition:**  
  - **Staff/Senior Staff:** Technical stewardship, approvals, security-sensitive access.  
  - **Senior/Lead Engineer:** Feature execution, code reviews, CI gatekeeping.  
  - **Program Manager:** Cross-team coordination, schedules, and risk management.  
  - **Director/Principal Engineer:** Architecture alignment, policy, and escalation.

- **Access control (CCI):**  
  - **Restricted artifacts:** Keys, licenses, golden models, confidential RTL.  
  - **Access tiers:** Staff-and-above for sensitive repos; read-only dashboards for broader stakeholders.  
  - **Auditability:** Mandatory code reviews, protected branches, signed commits.

- **Scaling across teams:**  
  - **Hundreds of teams:** One representative per team with ‚â•2‚Äì3 years domain tenure to ensure context continuity.  
  - **Governance:** Central workflow council to evolve policies, templates, and compliance.

## Repository architecture

Organize work into layered, modular Git repos for clarity and scalable integration.

### Top-level integration

- **Chip integrator repo (Monorepo-of-repos):**  
  - **Purpose:** Compose SoC-level views aggregating CPU, GPU, NPU, Camera, Video, Audio, NoCs, and shared IPs.  
  - **Contents:** Submodules/subtrees pointing to per-domain repos; global dashboards; cross-domain CI; release manifests.

- **Per-domain repos (examples):**  
  - **CPU_RTL, CPU_Verification, CPU_Logic_Design, CPU_DFT, CPU_PD_Floorplan, CPU_PD_Placement, CPU_PD_CTS, CPU_PD_PnR, CPU_PD_STA, CPU_PD_PV, CPU_BTO, CPU_MTO, CPU_Post_Silicon_Validation**  
  - **Mirror for other domains:** GPU_*, NPU_*, Camera_*, Video_*, Audio_*, NoC_*

### Layered design levels

- **DL1:** Top-level functional blocks (e.g., instruction decode, MMU, memory systems, execution pipeline).  
- **DL2:** Subsystems within DL1 (e.g., L1 caches/TLBs, dynamic branch predictor, integer/vector execute, L2 cache/TLB).  
- **DL3:** Leaf subblocks and micro-architectural units within DL2.

```

## Workflow and pipelines

Codify end-to-end flows with CI/CD and AI-assisted agents to remove manual toil.

### Common workflow primitives

- **Testcases launch:**  
  - **Inputs:** Configs, seeds, license checks, resource quotas.  
  - **Actions:** Dispatch sims/runs, track job IDs, auto-retry on transient failures.  
  - **Outputs:** Run registry entries, tags for reproducibility.

- **Run summary:**  
  - **Collection:** Logs, waveforms, coverage, timing/power reports.  
  - **Normalization:** Standard parsers emit JSON for dashboards.  
  - **Storage:** Artifact buckets keyed by commit SHA and manifest.

- **Analysis:**  
  - **Checks:** KPI extraction, trend lines, regression deltas, anomaly detection.  
  - **Gatekeeping:** Automatic pass/fail on quality bars.

- **BTO/MTO dashboards:**  
  - **BTO:** Build-to-order variants, feature matrices, release readiness.  
  - **MTO:** Make-to-order customizations, constraint management, delivery timelines.

- **LLR (Lessons learned):**  
  - **Capture:** Root causes, fixes, mitigations, playbooks.  
  - **Reuse:** Link to templates, pre-checks, and CI guardrails.

- **Bugs/errors:**  
  - **Tracking:** Consistent IDs, repro steps, affected DL levels and domains.  
  - **Linkage:** Tie issues to runs and manifests for traceability.

### CI/CD stages (typical)

```yaml
stages:
  - lint
  - build
  - simulate
  - analyze
  - regress
  - synth/place/route
  - sta/pv
  - package
```

- **Lint/build:** Sanity checks, schema validation, dependency locks.  
- **Simulate/analyze:** Batch dispatch; coverage/KPI extraction emits machine-readable artifacts.  
- **Regress:** Seed sweeps; flakiness detectors; license/backoff strategies.  
- **Synth/Place/Route:** Deterministic flows with constraint manifests; reproducible containers.  
- **STA/PV:** Timing closure checks; physical verification.  
- **Package:** Release bundles, dashboards, and signed manifests.

- **Register rename**  
- **Instruction issue**  
- **Execution pipeline**  
- **MMU**  
- **Data memory system (L1)**  
- **L2 memory system**  
- **CPU bridge / debug interfaces**  
- **Trace/PMU subsystems:** TRBE, Trace Unit, SPE, PMU, ELA, GIC CPU interface, AMU

### DL2 subsystems

- **Instruction side:**  
  - **L1 instruction cache**  
  - **L1 instruction TLB**

### Example: architecture-to-specs linkage

```text
CPU_Core_Architecture --> Design_Specs (Power, Performance, Area) --> Execution Flows
```

Use manifests to trace requirements through RTL, verification, PD, and validation results.

---

## Automation, dashboards, and metrics

Create a consistent, queryable surface for humans and AI agents.

### Dashboards

- **Head view:**  
  - **Panels:** Testcases launch, run summary, analysis, BTO/MTO dashboard, scripts, LLR, bugs/errors.  
  - **Navigation:** Drill-down from chip to domain to DL level.

- **Execution KPIs:**  
  - **Verification:** Coverage (code/functional), pass rate, flakiness index, bug discovery rate.  
  - **PD:** Timing slack, congestion heatmaps, DRC/LVS counts, IR drop.  
  - **Performance/power:** Throughput, latency, energy per operation, thermal margins.  
  - **Ops:** License utilization, queue times, run reliability.

### AI/agent integration

- **Query layer:**  
  - **Inputs:** Normalized run artifacts (JSON), manifest metadata, topology.  
  - **Capabilities:** Answer ‚Äúwhat changed?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere did timing regress?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhich seeds are flaky?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs blocking tapeout?‚Äù

- **Action layer:**  
  - **Automations:** Auto-retry runs, triage bugs to owners, generate repro bundles, propose mitigations based on LLR.  
  - **Guardrails:** Only act on non-destructive operations without human approval; maintain audit logs.

  - **Initialize submodules:** `git submodule update --init --recursive`  
  - **Install toolchains:** Containerized environments per domain; lock versions in manifests.  
  - **Bootstrap dashboards:** `make dashboard` or `bazel run //dashboards:serve` (adapt to your build system).

- **Develop in layers:**
