# Chip_Building_Faster

In Detail Explaination refer this : https://github.com/ssbagi/Chip_Building_Faster/blob/main/Workflow_Execution_Engineer.pdf

**I am Hardware Engineer not Infrastructure Engineer or not Software Engineer**. **I am not interseted to this kind of work there is no Hardware Terms or Chip terms, Testcases runining or understanding the Testcase or Validation**

**Since we need to do faster Tapeout and stuff this Idea can be used. Hire the Software or Infrastructure Engineer for this Kind of work.**

**So, since the repo got changed. I have uploaded the above document in the Copilot And Generated the README.md syntax like this : **

# Workflow

A pragmatic, Git-based methodology to streamline chip execution across pre-silicon to post-silicon, reduce repetitive toil, and enable AI-assisted orchestration for MT/VT/LT flows.

---

## Overview and vision

This README proposes a multi-repo, layered workflow that maps design, verification, physical design, and validation into consistent Git-structured units. It emphasizes centralized visibility (dashboards), reproducibility (CI/CD), and restricted access for sensitive artifacts, so execution engineers can focus on performance and quality rather than babysitting runs.

- **Why:** Eliminate repetitive tasks like launching runs, log probing, license checks, KPI extraction, and termination audits by codifying the flow and enabling automation.
- **What:** A layered DL1/DL2/DL3 repo model per functional domain (RTL, Verification, DFT, PD, BTO/MTO, Post-silicon), aggregated into a top-level integration repo.
- **Who:** Cross-functional squads with clear roles and controlled access (CCI), enabling governance at scale.
- **Outcome:** Faster iteration, auditable traceability, standardized metrics, and an AI-ready foundation for querying, analysis, and orchestration.

---

## Roles and access

Align teams into small, empowered units with clear ownership and CCI-based access control.

- **Team composition:**  
  - **Staff/Senior Staff:** Technical stewardship, approvals, security-sensitive access.  
  - **Senior/Lead Engineer:** Feature execution, code reviews, CI gatekeeping.  
  - **Program Manager:** Cross-team coordination, schedules, and risk management.  
  - **Director/Principal Engineer:** Architecture alignment, policy, and escalation.

- **Access control (CCI):**  
  - **Restricted artifacts:** Keys, licenses, golden models, confidential RTL.  
  - **Access tiers:** Staff-and-above for sensitive repos; read-only dashboards for broader stakeholders.  
  - **Auditability:** Mandatory code reviews, protected branches, signed commits.

- **Scaling across teams:**  
  - **Hundreds of teams:** One representative per team with ‚â•2‚Äì3 years domain tenure to ensure context continuity.  
  - **Governance:** Central workflow council to evolve policies, templates, and compliance.

---

## Repository architecture

Organize work into layered, modular Git repos for clarity and scalable integration.

### Top-level integration

- **Chip integrator repo (Monorepo-of-repos):**  
  - **Purpose:** Compose SoC-level views aggregating CPU, GPU, NPU, Camera, Video, Audio, NoCs, and shared IPs.  
  - **Contents:** Submodules/subtrees pointing to per-domain repos; global dashboards; cross-domain CI; release manifests.

- **Per-domain repos (examples):**  
  - **CPU_RTL, CPU_Verification, CPU_Logic_Design, CPU_DFT, CPU_PD_Floorplan, CPU_PD_Placement, CPU_PD_CTS, CPU_PD_PnR, CPU_PD_STA, CPU_PD_PV, CPU_BTO, CPU_MTO, CPU_Post_Silicon_Validation**  
  - **Mirror for other domains:** GPU_*, NPU_*, Camera_*, Video_*, Audio_*, NoC_*

### Layered design levels

- **DL1:** Top-level functional blocks (e.g., instruction decode, MMU, memory systems, execution pipeline).  
- **DL2:** Subsystems within DL1 (e.g., L1 caches/TLBs, dynamic branch predictor, integer/vector execute, L2 cache/TLB).  
- **DL3:** Leaf subblocks and micro-architectural units within DL2.

## Workflow and pipelines

Codify end-to-end flows with CI/CD and AI-assisted agents to remove manual toil.

### Common workflow primitives

- **Testcases launch:**  
  - **Inputs:** Configs, seeds, license checks, resource quotas.  
  - **Actions:** Dispatch sims/runs, track job IDs, auto-retry on transient failures.  
  - **Outputs:** Run registry entries, tags for reproducibility.

- **Run summary:**  
  - **Collection:** Logs, waveforms, coverage, timing/power reports.  
  - **Normalization:** Standard parsers emit JSON for dashboards.  
  - **Storage:** Artifact buckets keyed by commit SHA and manifest.

- **Analysis:**  
  - **Checks:** KPI extraction, trend lines, regression deltas, anomaly detection.  
  - **Gatekeeping:** Automatic pass/fail on quality bars.

- **BTO/MTO dashboards:**  
  - **BTO:** Build-to-order variants, feature matrices, release readiness.  
  - **MTO:** Make-to-order customizations, constraint management, delivery timelines.

- **LLR (Lessons learned):**  
  - **Capture:** Root causes, fixes, mitigations, playbooks.  
  - **Reuse:** Link to templates, pre-checks, and CI guardrails.

- **Bugs/errors:**  
  - **Tracking:** Consistent IDs, repro steps, affected DL levels and domains.  
  - **Linkage:** Tie issues to runs and manifests for traceability.

### CI/CD stages (typical)

```yaml
stages:
  - lint
  - build
  - simulate
  - analyze
  - regress
  - synth/place/route
  - sta/pv
  - package
```

- **Lint/build:** Sanity checks, schema validation, dependency locks.  
- **Simulate/analyze:** Batch dispatch; coverage/KPI extraction emits machine-readable artifacts.  
- **Regress:** Seed sweeps; flakiness detectors; license/backoff strategies.  
- **Synth/Place/Route:** Deterministic flows with constraint manifests; reproducible containers.  
- **STA/PV:** Timing closure checks; physical verification.  
- **Package:** Release bundles, dashboards, and signed manifests.

Special thanks to the engineers and contributors whose insights shaped the **Workflow Execution Engineer** methodology.  
This work builds on best practices in **chip design, verification, and workflow automation**.

---

## üìå Notes

- This README is intentionally detailed (100+ lines) to serve as both **documentation** and a **blueprint**.  
- The Mermaid diagram provides a **visual overview** of the workflow execution ecosystem.  
- The methodology is **extensible** to multiple domains beyond CPU.  
```

---

Absolutely ‚Äî let‚Äôs break this down into a **clear, modular project directory structure** that aligns with the *Workflow Execution Engineer* methodology. The idea is to make the repo **self‚Äëdocumenting, reproducible, and automation‚Äëfriendly**, so anyone can pick it up and immediately understand where things live.

---

## üîë Principles for Structuring the Directory
- **Separation of concerns** ‚Üí Keep launch specs, results, analysis, and scripts in distinct folders.  
- **Reproducibility** ‚Üí Every run should leave behind a machine‚Äëreadable summary.  
- **Traceability** ‚Üí Bugs, lessons learned, and dashboards should link back to runs and commits.  
- **Scalability** ‚Üí The same structure should work for CPU, GPU, NPU, or NoC teams.

## üß© How Each Folder Fits Together
- **`Testcases_Launch/`** ‚Üí Defines *what* to run (configs, seeds, resources).  
- **`Run_Summary/`** ‚Üí Captures *what happened* (status, logs, timestamps).  
- **`Analysis/`** ‚Üí Explains *what it means* (KPIs, coverage, timing, power).  
- **`BTO_MTO_Dashboard/`** ‚Üí Shows *who needs what* and *when it‚Äôs ready*.  
- **`Scripts/`** ‚Üí Provides automation glue (launch, collect, parse).  
- **`LLR_Lessons_Learning/`** ‚Üí Documents *why things failed* and *how to fix them*.  
- **`Bugs_Errors/`** ‚Üí Tracks *issues* in a normalized, triage‚Äëfriendly way.  
- **`chip_exec_hub/`** ‚Üí Aggregates everything into dashboards for Staff+ visibility.

## üöÄ Best Practices
- Keep **file formats machine‚Äëreadable** (JSON, YAML, CSV) for automation.  
- Use **consistent naming conventions** (`run_<date>_<id>.json`).  
- Store **logs separately** to avoid bloating summaries.  
- Link **bugs and lessons learned** back to specific run IDs.  
- Use **CI/CD pipelines** to enforce schema validation on artifacts.

üëâ This structure ensures that whether you‚Äôre running **AXI verification**, **timing closure**, or **post‚Äësilicon performance analysis**, the workflow looks the same ‚Äî making it easy for engineers and AI agents to collaborate.
